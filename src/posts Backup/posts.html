<h1>HTML - Hypertext Markup Language</h1>
<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used language to write Web Pages.Hypertext refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked together. Thus, the link available on a webpage is called Hypertext.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up" a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display.</p>
<p>Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between researchers.</p>
<p>Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags available in HTML language.</p>

<h1>Basic HTML Document - HTML Tags</h1>
<p>As told earlier, HTML is a markup language and makes use of various tags to format the content. These tags are enclosed within angle braces. Except few tags, most of the tags have their corresponding closing tags.</p>
<p>To learn HTML, you will need to study various tags and understand how they behave, while formatting a textual document. Learning HTML is simple as users have to learn the usage of different tags in order to format the text or images to make a beautiful webpage.</p>
<p>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommends to use lowercase tags starting from HTML 4.</p>
<h4>!DOCTYPE</h4>
<p>This tag defines the document type and HTML version.</p>
<h4>html</h4>
<p>This tag encloses the complete HTML document and mainly comprises of document header</p>
<h4>head</h4>
<p>This tag represents the document's header which can keep other HTML tags</p>
<h4>title</h4>
<p>The title tag is used inside the head tag to mention the document title.</p>
<h4>body</h4>
<p>This tag represents the document's body which keeps other HTML tags</p>
<h4>h1</h4>
<p>This tag represents the heading.</p>
<h4>p</h4>
<p>This tag represents a paragraph.</p>

<h1>CSS - Cascading Style Sheet</h1>
<p>CSS is used to control the style of a web document in a simple and easy way.</p>
<p>CSS is the acronym for Cascading Style Sheet. This tutorial covers both the versions CSS1,CSS2 and CSS3, and gives a complete understanding of CSS, starting from its basics to advanced concepts.</p>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.</p>
<p>CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.</p>
<p>CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.</p>

<!-- CSS POST2 -->

<h1>Advantages of CSS</h1>
<p><b>CSS saves time</b> − You can write CSS once and then reuse same sheet in multiple HTML pages. You can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want.</p>
<p><b>Pages load faster</b> − If you are using CSS, you do not need to write HTML tag attributes every time. Just write one CSS rule of a tag and apply it to all the occurrences of that tag. So less code means faster download times.</p>
<p><b>Easy maintenance</b> − To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically.</p>
<p><b>Superior styles to HTML</b> − CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.</p>
<p><b>Multiple Device Compatibility</b> − Style sheets allow content to be optimized for more than one type of device. By using the same HTML document, different versions of a website can be presented for handheld devices such as PDAs and cell phones or for printing.</p>
<p><b>Global web standards</b> − Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it is being recommended to use CSS. So its a good idea to start using CSS in all the HTML pages to make them compatible to future browsers.</p>
<p><b>Offline Browsing</b> − CSS can store web applications locally with the help of an offline catche.Using of this, we can view offline websites.The cache also ensures faster loading and better overall performance of the website.</p>
<p><b>Platform Independence</b> − The Script offer consistent platform independence and can support latest browsers as well.</p>

<h1>JavaScript </h1>
<p>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. It is designed for creating network-centric applications. It is complimentary to and integrated with Java. JavaScript is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform.</p>
<h3>What is JavaScript ?</h3>
<p>Javascript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.</p>
<p>JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.</p>
<h3>Client-side JavaScript</h3>
<p>Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. The script should be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the code to be interpreted by the browser.</p>
<p>It means that a web page need not be a static HTML, but can include programs that interact with the user, control the browser, and dynamically create HTML content.</p>
<p>The JavaScript client-side mechanism provides many advantages over traditional CGI server-side scripts. For example, you might use JavaScript to check if the user has entered a valid e-mail address in a form field.</p>
<p>The JavaScript code is executed when the user submits the form, and only if all the entries are valid, they would be submitted to the Web Server.</p>
<p>JavaScript can be used to trap user-initiated events such as button clicks, link navigation, and other actions that the user initiates explicitly or implicitly.</p>

<!-- JS POST2 -->

<h1>Advantages of JavaScript</h1>
<p>The merits of using JavaScript are −</p>
<p><b>Less server interaction</b> − You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on your server.</p>
<p><b>Immediate feedback to the visitors</b> − They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.</p>
<p><b>Increased interactivity</b> − You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard</p>
<p><b>Richer interfaces</b> − You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.</p>

<h1>PHP - Server-Side Scripting Language</h1>
<p>The PHP Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) is a programming language that allows web developers to create dynamic content that interacts with databases. PHP is basically used for developing web based software applications. This tutorial helps you to build your base with PHP.</p>
<p>PHP started out as a small open source project that evolved as more and more people found out how useful it was. Rasmus Lerdorf unleashed the first version of PHP way back in 1994.</p>
<p>PHP is a recursive acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor".PHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites.</p>
<p>It is integrated with a number of popular databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server.PHP is pleasingly zippy in its execution, especially when compiled as an Apache module on the Unix side. The MySQL server, once started, executes even very complex queries with huge result sets in record-setting time.</p>
<p>PHP supports a large number of major protocols such as POP3, IMAP, and LDAP. PHP4 added support for Java and distributed object architectures (COM and CORBA), making n-tier development a possibility for the first time.</p>

<h1>MySQL - Open-Source RDBMS</h1>
<p>MySQL is the most popular Open Source Relational SQL Database Management System. MySQL is one of the best RDBMS being used for developing various web-based software applications. MySQL is developed, marketed and supported by MySQL AB, which is a Swedish company. This tutorial will give you a quick start to MySQL and make you comfortable with MySQL programming.</p>
<h3>What is a Database?</h3>
<p>A database is a separate application that stores a collection of data. Each database has one or more distinct APIs for creating, accessing, managing, searching and replicating the data it holds.</p>
<p>Other kinds of data stores can also be used, such as files on the file system or large hash tables in memory but data fetching and writing would not be so fast and easy with those type of systems.</p>
<p>Nowadays, we use relational database management systems (RDBMS) to store and manage huge volume of data. This is called relational database because all the data is stored into different tables and relations are established using primary keys or other keys known as Foreign Keys.</p>


<!-- Mysql POST2 -->

<h1>RDBMS Terminology</h1>
<p>Before we proceed to explain the MySQL database system, let us revise a few definitions related to the database.</p>
<p><b>Database</b> − A database is a collection of tables, with related data.</p>
<p><b>Table</b> − A table is a matrix with data. A table in a database looks like a simple spreadsheet.</p>
<p><b>Column</b> − One column (data element) contains data of one and the same kind, for example the column postcode.</p>
<p><b>Row</b> − A row (= tuple, entry or record) is a group of related data, for example the data of one subscription.</p>
<p><b>Redundancy</b> − Storing data twice, redundantly to make the system faster</p>
<p><b>Primary Key</b> − A primary key is unique. A key value can not occur twice in one table. With a key, you can only find one row.</p>
<p><b>Foreign Key</b> − A foreign key is the linking pin between two tables.</p>
<p><b>Compound Key</b> − A compound key (composite key) is a key that consists of multiple columns, because one column is not sufficiently unique.</p>
<p><b>Index</b> − An index in a database resembles an index at the back of a book.</p>
<p><b>Referential Integrity</b> − Referential Integrity makes sure that a foreign key value always points to an existing row.</p>
